## Introduction

When it comes to building a website, there are many ways you can get it built. This ranges from building one with a WYSIWYG editor or, by coding one yourself with HTML, CSS and Javascript. This part of website building is the most talked about; you could probably find thousands of resources to help you accomplish this. But one lesser discussed aspect of web development is actually hosting it. For static sites, you can just easily use Github Pages, or another service to distribute the files. But, what if you want to do everything from scratch with your own web servers. In this blog post, I will be discussing how I hosted my own website using only nginx and deployed it to my own domain.
