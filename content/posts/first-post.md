[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is an amazing piece of software which allows you to easily generate static sites using the power of markdown. I was shocked when I found out about it. You can even make your own themes which I decided to do. Here is how I set it up.

## 1. Installation

I just installed a pre built binary from the [Download Page](https://gohugo.io/installation/). You can install hugo on Windows, Mac OS and Linux. Ensure that hugo is also in your system PATH.

## 2. Setup

I created a new folder and ran this command in it.

```shell
# Create a new site
hugo new site .
```

## 3. Theming

I skipped the step of installing a theme and instead made my own from scratch which took about 2 hours. It ended up turning out much better than expected. I found the experience very intuitive.

## 4. Writing

After all of that, I was ready to write markdown and have the content turned into an html website using my styles.

## Conclusion

Hugo is a very fast way to create static websites. It may take a while to setup, but it is all worth it as you can enjoy the comfort of writing your sites in markdown instead of dealing with plain HTML every time you want to add a page.
